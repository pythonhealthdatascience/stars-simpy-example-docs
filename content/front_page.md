This book contains example enhanced documentation and open working for a discrete-event simulation model. The model is a based on the treatment centre example in Nelson [1]. The model is implemented in `python` and `simpy`.

##   Towards Sharing Tools and Artifacts for Reusable Simulation: example enhanced documentation for a `simpy` model. 

The materials and methods in this repository support work towards developing the S.T.A.R.S healthcare framework (**S**haring **T**ools and **A**rtifacts for **R**eusable **S**imulations in healthcare).  The code and written materials here demonstrate the application of S.T.A.R.S' version 1 to sharing a `simpy` discrete-event simuilation model and associated research artifacts.  

* All artifacts in this repository are linked to study researchers via ORCIDs;
* Model code is made available under a MIT license;
* Python dependencies are managed through `conda`;`
* The python code itself can be viewed and executed in Jupyter notebooks via [Binder](https://mybinder.org); 
* The model is documented and explained in a [Jupyter book website](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-simpy-example-docs) served up by GitHub pages;
* The materials are deposited and made citatable using Zenodo;
* The models are sharable with other researchers and the NHS without the need to install software.
